## Dividita: Responsibility. Shared.

The goal of the Dividita project is to empower people to self-organize and share equal control over an organization.

This project is currently in brainstorming phase but if you want to join the developer chat just [send us an email](mailto:lily.m.mayfield@gmail.com) and tell us why.
